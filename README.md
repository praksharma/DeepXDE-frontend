# DeepXDE-frontend

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/praksharma/DeepXDE-frontend)](https://github.com/praksharma/DeepXDE-frontend/blob/main/LICENSE)

A GUI frontend for [DeepXDE](https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) made in PyQt5. This project is in alpha unless you see a release.

I think the frontend will be released as a compressed `tar.gz` file. You just need to uncompress the archives at a suitable location and install [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) using the following command.

```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

## Learn GUI development
There are bunch of tools to develop GUIs. [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)) is a cross platform tool unlike [Visual Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio) on Windows or [GTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK) on GNOME.

Sometimes, a Qt (written in C++) frontend for a software written in Python, such as DeepXDE may create a lot of issues. Thus, it is best to use PyQt to develop GUIs for Python software.

[This](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-introduction-to-pyqt5/) is an amazing place to kickstart PyQt5. Btw, [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/) is already released and I might ship the development to PyQt6.
